1️⃣ User Adds Items to Cart
    User selects books from multiple stores.
    They see total price, item breakdown, and choose payment method.

2️⃣ Checkout & Payment
    At Checkout, user selects a payment method:
    Online Payment (Card, PayPal, etc.) → Payment is processed immediately.
    Cash on Delivery (COD) → Payment will be made upon delivery.
    ✅ Single checkout, one total payment, but orders are split per store.

3️⃣ Order Creation (Split Per Store)
    After checkout, we create a separate order for each store, with these details:

    	        Online Payment	                COD
payment_status	Paid (since paid at checkout)	Pending (waiting for delivery)
order_status	Pending	                        Pending

    ✅ User only sees a single checkout summary, but orders are managed per store.

4️⃣ Store Processes the Order
    Each store can:
        Approve & ship the order.
        Cancel if the item is unavailable (refunds only for online payments).
    ✅ Orders are processed independently per store.

5️⃣ Order Delivery & Final Payment Handling
    If Online Payment:
        ✅ Store ships the order → No change (Already paid).

    If COD:
        ✅ Customer pays upon delivery → Store marks payment_status = Paid.
        ❌ Customer refuses order → Store marks order_status = Canceled.

6️⃣ Refunds & Cancellations
    If an order is canceled by a store:
        ✅ Online Payment → That store’s subtotal is refunded.
        ❌ COD → No refund needed, since payment wasn’t collected.
